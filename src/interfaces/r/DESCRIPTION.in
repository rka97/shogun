Description: SHOGUN - is a new machine learning toolbox with focus on large
    scale kernel methods and especially on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with focus
    to bioinformatics. It provides a generic SVM object interfacing to several
    different SVM implementations. Each of the SVMs can be combined with a variety
    of the many kernels implemented. It can deal with weighted linear combination
    of a number of sub-kernels, each of which not necessarily working on the same
    domain, where  an optimal sub-kernel weighting can be learned using Multiple
    Kernel Learning.  Apart from SVM 2-class classification and regression
    problems, a number of linear methods like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
    Linear Programming Machine (LPM), (Kernel) Perceptrons and also algorithms to
    train hidden markov models are implemented. The input feature-objects can be
    dense, sparse or strings and of type int/short/double/char and can be converted
    into different feature types. Chains of preprocessors (e.g.  substracting the
    mean) can be attached to each feature object allowing for on-the-fly
    pre-processing.
